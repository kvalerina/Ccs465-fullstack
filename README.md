# CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
# Karina Aronov

In my full-stack project, I worked with different types of frontend development like Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). Express HTML and JavaScript provided a straightforward way to serve dynamic web pages and handle user interactions, which was great for getting started quickly. On the other hand, the SPA approach offered a smoother and more interactive user experience by updating content dynamically without refreshing the page. This comparison demonstrated how Express HTML is more straightforward and yet functional for applications with fewer dynamic requirements, while SPAs are more contemporary and user-friendly. The NoSQL structure of MongoDB was perfect for managing the app's data on the backend. For an application that didn't require the strict structure of SQL databases, its adaptability in storing documents that resembled JSON made it simple to map data straight from the frontend.

One of the key connections between the frontend and backend was JSON, which acted as the data format for communication. JSON differs from JavaScript in that itâ€™s purely a data format, not a programming language. It allowed the frontend and backend to "speak the same language," making data exchange seamless. I made several code refactorings along the way to enhance functionality, such as streamlining data transfer between components or dividing more complex sections into reusable user interface elements. These reusable components reduced duplication, saved time, and simplified app maintenance. Another significant step in the process was testing the API, particularly endpoints using various methods including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Testing became more difficult as security layers like authentication were added, but it also made it clear how crucial it is to protect user data. All things considered, this course has significantly helped my development as a developer by providing me with practical experience creating full-stack applications and refining my problem-solving and programming abilities.
